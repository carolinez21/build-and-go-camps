# thermal-massing-app
A Wolfram Mathematica app which takes building criteria input from the user:

- building material
- average number of people intended to be in the building at one time
- number of floors
- floor height
- length of floor
- width of floor
- will the floors be used as thermal mass?

and then calculates and outputs the design requirements for the building to be at a comfortable interior temperature based on the principles of thermal massing coupled with buoyancy ventilation in a thermal feedback loop.
