# Build & Go Camps

Build & Go Camps is an app that efficiently designs easily transported and energy-efficient modular buildings for Syrians who are displaced during the war. The app was built using Wolfram Mathematica.

The app takes building criteria input from the user:

- building material
- average building occupancy
- number of floors
- floor height
- length of floor
- width of floor
- will the floors be used as thermal mass?

and then calculates and outputs the design requirements for the building to be at a comfortable interior temperature and energy-efficient based on the principles of thermal massing coupled with buoyancy ventilation in a thermal feedback loop.
